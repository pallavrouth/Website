  About me
---

<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I am a Ph.D. student in the [department of marketing](https://business.utsa.edu/department-of-marketing/) at the University of Texas at San Antonio. I'm extremely fond of statistical programming and I frequently find myself using R to answer intriguing research questions within my field. 

In a nutshell, my research focuses on managing interactions in a variety of business settings. And how different aspects of interactions impacts relational or performance outcomes. So, most of my work is in the relationship marketing area but I have a special interest in ideas that focus on B2B interactions and sales management, and customer relationship management.
