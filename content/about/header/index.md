  About me
---

<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I am a Ph.D. student in the [department of marketing](https://business.utsa.edu/department-of-marketing/) at the University of Texas at San Antonio. I'm extremely fond of statistical programming and I frequently find myself using R to answer intriguing research questions within my field. 

To be very specific, I study consumers' engagement behavior in a variety of business setting. I study its antecedents and its effect on firm functions like sales and profit margins.
