  About me
---

<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I am a Ph.D. student in the [department of marketing](https://business.utsa.edu/department-of-marketing/) at the University of Texas at San Antonio. I'm extremely fond of statistical programming and I frequently find myself using R (and sometimes Python) to answer intriguing research questions within my field. 

As an aspiring marketing strategy scholar, I have always been drawn to ideas that address critical, strategic, and/or novel issues facing managers, marketers, and key decision-makers. In particular, issues that center around managing dynamic interactions between customers or between firms, pique my interest. My current research addresses some of these issues on online platform markets and organizational frontlines and how it impacts relational outcomes. 

My ongoing research projects examine how C2C platform managers and B2B sales representatives manage interactions with customers by implementing strategies that improve the quality of interactions or by implementing actions that build and maintain relationships.
