  I mainly wish to document and share my knowledge in statistics or econometrics using R and sometimes python. Other than that, I also hope to document my experiences as a Ph.D. student. I hope that one day my blog will become a useful digital archive for my future self as well as others who share the same interests and aspirations as me.
