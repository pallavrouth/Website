Using IVs to deal with omitted variable bias is very common in a variety of disciplines including marketing. In 2014, Peter Rossi published an excellent article in Marketing Science that highlights the major issues with the commonly used IV strategies in marketing. This article also provides an excellent overview of other IV topics such as (1) types of IV estimators and (2) the consequences of using weak or invalid IV. 

He covers (2) in section 3.4 and 3.5 of this article where he provides an excellent illustration of the problem of weak and invalid IV from a sampling distribution perspective. Unfortunately, this section is also hard to understand for non-technical readers.

In this blog post, I try to elaborate on his main takeaways from section 3.4 and 3.5. I also use simulations to replicate the findings he presents in this section which might also help readers get more clarity when they read the actual article.
