  description: "This is my personal blog where I share my knowledge on concepts in statistics and econometrics that intrigue me. I try to organize my thoughts in the form of a tutorial that uses R to explain these concepts in a clear intuitive manner.\n    
  
  I usually try to organize my blog posts with certain 'series' with a common theme. But, once in a while I also publish standalone posts. You can either search for a topic within these series or using tags or categories.\n  
  
  I welcome helpful comments to all my blog posts. You can also reach out to me via the contact form below."

** No content below YAML for the blog _index. This file provides front matter for the listing page layout and sidebar content. It is also a branch bundle, and all settings under `cascade` provide front matter for all pages inside blog/. You may still override any of these by changing them in a page's front matter.**
